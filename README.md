## Introduction

### Traditional Methods of Password Strength Assessment

Traditionally, password strength is assessed using a set of predefined rules or metrics. These methods generally focus on the superficial attributes of a password rather than its intrinsic strength against attack methods. Common criteria include:

* Length of the Password: Typically, a longer password is considered more secure. A minimum number of characters is often required.
* Use of Special Characters: Passwords that include non-alphanumeric characters such as @, #, $, etc., are often ranked as stronger.
* Mix of Upper and Lowercase Letters: The inclusion of both uppercase and lowercase letters is encouraged to increase password complexity.
* Presence of Numbers: Adding numeric characters is viewed as another way to enhance password security.
* Avoidance of Common Passwords and Patterns: Passwords that match common patterns or known weak passwords (like "password123" or "123456") are flagged as weak.

While these rules are straightforward and relatively easy to implement, they have significant drawbacks. They do not account for the holistic security of a password but rather check it against a checklist. As a result, a password might meet all traditional criteria and still be vulnerable due to predictable patterns or sequences that are easy for a human or a computer algorithm to guess.

### Why Use Machine Learning for Password Strength Assessment?

Machine learning, particularly through the use of neural networks, offers a more nuanced approach to assessing password strength. Instead of relying on static rules, machine learning models can learn and predict based on the data from numerous password breaches and security patterns. Here are some advantages of using machine learning over traditional methods:

* Pattern Recognition: Neural networks excel in recognizing complex patterns in data. In the context of passwords, they can learn to identify subtle patterns that might make a password easy to guess, even if it complies with traditional strength criteria.
* Adaptive Learning: Unlike static rule-based systems, machine learning models can improve over time. They adapt as new types of password breaches occur and as users create new kinds of password combinations.
* Assessment of Contextual Strength: Machine learning can evaluate not just the structure of a password but its strength relative to the most recent hacking techniques and leaked password databases.
* Predictive Capabilities: By training on historical data, neural networks can better predict the likelihood that a given password will be compromised, thereby providing a dynamic assessment of password strength.

In this notebook, we will explore how to harness the power of neural networks to create a model that assesses password strength more effectively and accurately than traditional methods. We will build and train a model that classifies passwords as either weak or strong based on their intrinsic characteristics and learned patterns, demonstrating the potential of machine learning to enhance cybersecurity.
